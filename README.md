## Navigation

The SBT's `groll` command is used to navigate between the commits of this workshop.
Command must be followed by one of the following arguments:

`initial` - go to the first commit

`next`    – moves to the next commit

`show`    – shows the current commit id and message, if current commit is in history

`list`    – shows the full commit history

`prev`    – moves to the previous commit

NB! Groll commands don't work from subproject's.
