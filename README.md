## Navigation

The SBT's `groll` command is used to navigate between the commits of this workshop.
Command must be followed by one of the following arguments:

`show` – shows the current commit id and message, if current commit is in history,

`list` – shows the full commit history,

`next` – moves to the next commit,

`prev` – moves to the previous commit.

NB! Groll commands don't work from subproject's.
